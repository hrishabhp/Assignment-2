# Assignment-2
This repository contains two fundamental Python programs designed for beginners to learn basic programming concepts.
1. Even or Odd Checker
A simple program that determines whether a user-input number is even or odd.
2. Sum Calculator (1-50)
A program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

Program 1: Even or Odd Checker
Code Explanation -

1.Uses input() to get user input
2.Converts input to integer using int()
3.Uses modulo operator (%) to check divisibility by 2
4.Displays result with if-else statement

Program 2: Sum Calculator (1-50)
Code Explanation -

1.Uses for loop with range(1, 51) to iterate from 1 to 50
2.Accumulates sum using a variable
3.Displays the final sum
